title: Copepod Occurence Model

## The Challenge

A key challenge with the UVP, and other in-situ imaging tools, is the low sampling volume can make it challenging to accurately report organisms with occur at low abundances. This is a particularly large challenge in an oligotrophic system such as the Sargasso Sea [Barth & Stone 2022](https://thealexbarth.github.io/Oligotrophic_in-situ_net_comparison/main_analysis_03.html). Bisson et al. (2022) note that at low sampling volumes, the expected variance of large particle (or zooplankton) concentration) is often larger than the measured concentration. Due to this low-sampling volume issue, estimates of copepod abundance can be greatly driven by whether or not an individual was observed. As a result, using data as presence/absence offers a more reliable way to investigate copepod DVM in this system.

## Methodology

Site-occupancy models are an approach popularized in terrestrial and conservation biology, often with modelling rare species distribution. A powerful aspect of these class of models is the ability to separately estimate the occurrence probability (occupancy) and the detection probability (how likely it is to observe an organism in a site given it is actually there). Clearly, application of site-occupancy models to in-situ imaging data is attractive as the detection of zooplankton is a function of volume sampled while the zooplankton's occupancy of a given depth, time, or region are a function of environmental or biological factors. Here, we employ site-occupancy models to attempt to model the occupancy of copepods, and then the four morphogroups, throughout the water column at daytime and nighttime. These models can also be used to test the hypotheses regarding DVM signal, as they predict that there will be differences in daytime and nighttime occupancy at the surface.

At a basic level, the site-occupancy model is a hierarchical model with two main components. The biological component is a binomial process $z \sim Binomial(\psi)$, where $z$ is if the site is occupied given probability $\psi$. Then there is the observation process $Y \sim Bernoulli(p*z)$, where Y is the event of observing an organism. A requirement to adequately estimate $p$, is replicate "surveys" over a given "site". To apply this model to our system, we treat each profile as a "survey" to the "site" of a cruise. This approach is fundamentally similar to the pool-cast approach, commonly used in imaging studies, were all casts in a region are treated a joint observations of a larger water mass.

First to evaluate the overall efficacy of site-occupancy approach, we modeled occurrence of all copepods (regardless of morphogroup) in each depth-bin following 
$$
Y_{i,db_j,tod_k} \sim Bernoilli(p*z_{i,db_j,tod_k})
$$
$$
z \sim Binomial(\psi_{db_j,tod_k})
$$
$$
logit(p_i) \sim a_0 + a_{vs} * vs_{i}
$$
