# *Scientific Significance Statement*

Diel Vertical Migration is a widespread phenomenon across marine and freshwater systems. The predator evasion hypothesis suggests that DVM occurs as zooplankton attempt to escape visual predators. Yet, DVM itself is a costly and risky behavior. Thus, DVM should only occur when visual risk is high. Several studies have shown that copepod size influences the magnitude of DVM. However, an individualâ€™s visual risk may include traits beyond simply size. In this study, we utilize an in-situ imaging tool to reveal how copepod morphological traits influence DVM. Our findings show that both size and transparency influence DVM. This finding highlights that DVM is a complex behavior driven by copepod traits. Furthermore, this study exemplifies the ability of new technology to draw insights into plankton ecology.
