## Copepod morphospace

In this study, we built on methods for describing morphospaces from similar in-situ imaging studies [@trudnowska2021; @vilgrain2021; @sonnet2022]. The PCA-defined morphospace with the present data aligns well with the prior applications. Interestingly, the morphospace defined on Arctic copepods by @vilgrain2021 is extremely similar to the morphospace in this study. The proportion of morphological variation explained by each of the four principle components are extremely close between these two studies. It is possible that this is an artifact of the similarity of input data. Given the UVP has a limited range of observable size classes [@picheral2010], only copepods above a certain size were fed into both PCAs. Nonetheless, it is striking that the two morphospaces are similar considering the vastly different community compositions between the Arctic ocean and subtropical gyres [@soviadan2022].

## Morphology and DVM

The pattern of DVM described in this study is consistent with the general DVM pattern [@bianchi2016; @bandara2021]. The average vertical profiles display a clear day/night difference (Figure 3). In each 20m depth bin, there was large variation, often exceeding the average concentration. This large variation however, was expected. There can be considerable variation between UVP estimates of zooplankton abundance [@barth2022]. Additionally, in this study we pooled casts across multiple seasons. Variability in copepod DVM has been described across seasons [@whitmore2021]. While seasonal variability in DVM is in an interesting question in the Sargasso Sea, the nature of our dataset did not lend itself to this investigation. However, despite the need to pool UVP casts across, the signal of DVM was still observable. Previous studies using in-situ imaging have also noted a signal of DVM with copepods [@pan2018; @whitmore2021]. Yet due to small and uneven sampling, it can be a challenge to quantify DVM using in-situ imaging. As presented in this paper, bin-constrained bootstrapping offers a robust method to quantify WMD and investigate DVM hypotheses.

Copepod size had a clear effect in which larger copepods migrated further. This finding is consistent with several studies which have documented a size-dependent relationship for copepod DVM [@ohman2016; @aarflot2019; @pinti2019]. @ohman2016 noted that moderate-size copepods had the largest migrations. While this may seem contradictory to the present study, the difference between study systems needs be taken into account. The copepods described in the large (high PC1) group had a mean feret diameter of nearly 5mm. Conversely, in @ohman2016's study the "moderate" copepods ranged from 4mm-6mm. An effect of transparency on copepod DVM was only observed in the large copepod group. The large but more transparent copepods (low PC2, high PC1) did not have a detectable DVM signal. Yet the darker copepods (mid and high PC2) had a large DVM signal. @hays2003 described that copepod pigmentation could explain increased DVM with small (\<1mm) copepods. The lack of a transparency effect for the mid- and low PC1 groups in our study is surprising. One possibility is that the small, transparent copepods were not well sampled by the UVP (Figure 2). Alternatively, some copepods which do not migrate may have pigmentation to avoid damage from UV radiation. While well documented, predator avoidance may not always be the primary selective pressure on copepod traits. For example, if the costs of migration are too large for some copepods, they will remain near the surface. However, these copepods then are exposed to UV light and may increase pigmentation to reduce damage. Likely the relationship between color and DVM is the result of a delicate balance of minimizing multiple ecological and biological risks [@hansson2004; @hylander2014]. Nonetheless, our results provide some support for the relationship between copepod color and DVM magnitude. Grey-value in UVP-imaged copepods can be indicative of many features beyond simply pigmentation, notably egg-sacs and gut contents [@vilgrain2021]. Such characteristics vary much more between individuals and can have varied influences on DVM [@pearrejr.2003].
