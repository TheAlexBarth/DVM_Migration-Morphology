## Copepod morphospace

In this study, we built on methods for describing morphospaces from similar in-situ imaging studies [@trudnowska2021; @vilgrain2021; @sonnet2022]. The PCA-defined morphospace with the present data aligns well with the prior applications. Interestingly, the proportion of morphological variation explained by each axis in the morphospace defined on Arctic copepods by @vilgrain2021 is extremely similar to the morphospace axes in this study. This similarity is striking considering the vastly different copepod community compositions between the Arctic ocean and subtropical gyres [@soviadan2022]. The similarity of morphospaces could also be an artifact of the similarity of input data. Given the UVP has a limited range of observable size classes [@picheral2010], only copepods above a certain size were fed into both PCAs. Alternatively, the similarity of studies suggest that copepod morphological variation might be well described by these two primary axes. [@sonnet2022] used phytoplankton images to investigate how a morphospace could be used to evaluate community composition changes over time. Comparisons of copepod morphospaces across temporal and spatial scales may offer a useful metric for answering biogeographic and ecological questions.

## Morphology and DVM

The pattern of DVM described in this study is consistent with the general nighttime ascent DVM pattern [@bianchi2016; @bandara2021]. The average vertical profiles display a clear day/night difference (Figure 3). In each 20m depth bin, there was large variation, often exceeding the average concentration. This large variation however, was expected. There can be considerable variation between UVP estimates of zooplankton abundance [@barth2022]. Additionally, in this study we pooled casts across multiple seasons. Variability in copepod DVM has been described across seasons [@whitmore2021]. While seasonal variability in DVM is in an interesting question in the Sargasso Sea, the nature of our dataset did not lend itself to this investigation. However, despite the need to pool UVP casts across cruises, the signal of DVM was still observable. Previous studies using in-situ imaging have also noted a signal of DVM with copepods [@pan2018; @whitmore2021]. Yet due to small and uneven sampling, it can be a challenge to quantify DVM using in-situ imaging. As presented in this paper, bin-constrained bootstrapping offers a robust method to quantify WMD and investigate DVM hypotheses.

Consistent with the size-based hypothesis (H1), we documented a clear effect in which larger copepods migrated further. This finding is consistent with several studies which have documented a size-dependent relationship for copepod DVM [@ohman2016; @aarflot2019; @pinti2019]. @ohman2016 noted that moderate-size copepods had the largest migrations. While this may seem contradictory to the present study, the difference between study systems needs be taken into account. The copepods described in the large (high PC1) group had a mean feret diameter of nearly 5mm. Conversely, in @ohman2016's study the "moderate" copepods ranged from 4mm-6mm.

The transparency-based hypothesis (H2) was only supported by patterns within the large copepod group. The large but more transparent copepods (low PC2, high PC1) did not have a detectable DVM signal. Yet the darker copepods (mid and high PC2) had a large DVM signal. @hays2003 described that copepod pigmentation could explain increased DVM with small (\<1mm) copepods. The lack of a transparency effect for the mid- and low PC1 groups in our study is surprising. One possibility is that the small, transparent copepods were not well sampled by the UVP (Figure 2). Alternatively, some copepods which do not migrate may have pigmentation to avoid damage from UV radiation. The grey-value recorded in UVP-imaged copepods can be indicative of many features beyond simply pigmentation, notably egg-sacs and gut contents [@vilgrain2021]. Such characteristics vary much more between individuals and can have varied influences on DVM [@pearrejr.2003]. Thus the relationship between color and DVM is the result of a delicate balance of minimizing multiple ecological and biological risks [@hansson2004; @hylander2014]. While well documented, predator avoidance may not always be the primary selective pressure on copepod traits. For example, if the costs of migration are too large for some copepods, they will remain near the surface. However, these copepods then are exposed to UV light and may increase pigmentation to reduce damage.

## Conclusion

Overall, our results reveal a complex dynamic between copepod traits and DVM behavior. This study provided new insight into the DVM dynamics in oligotrophic gyres. While many studies have established size as a major trait influencing DVM, investigations into other traits are more limited. Here, we show using in-situ imaging that color/transparency has a major role in DVM behavior, for some sizes of copepods. How size and color influence DVM across seasons and environmental conditions remains a major question. As plankton in-situ imaging tools are used more commonly by oceanographers, larger datasets will facilitate new investigations.
