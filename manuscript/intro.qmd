# Introduction

Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a wide spread phenomena with large consequences in ocean ecosystems. DVM is the process of pelagic organisms vertically moving in the water column on a daily basis, often travelling dozens to hundreds of meters [@bianchi2016]. This large-scale event occurs across many taxa, from plankton to fish [@brierley2014]. However, DVM is particularly notable in zooplankton communities, whose migrations contribute substantially to biogeochemical cycles [@steinberg2017; @archibald2019; @siegel2023]. Zooplankton communities, largely dominated by copepods [@turner2004], will feed in surface layers of the ocean then migrate into deeper waters. Through this movement, copepods actively transport carbon to depth. Additionally, @kelly2019 described zooplankton DVM to be a major component of mesopelagic food webs. Thus it is critically important to understand the drivers of DVM.

Predominantly, zooplankton DVM is the movement from deep waters at daytime to shallower waters at night [@hays2003; @bianchi2016]. The leading explanation for this pattern is the predator-avoidance hypothesis [@bandara2021]. This hypothesis posits zooplankton evacuate the sunlit surface to evade visual predators then ascend at night to feed. However, the massive migration undertaken by these copepods is energetically expensive [@maas2018]. Therefore, the visual predator evasion hypothesis implies that DVM is a result of visual risk exceeding migration costs. However, a copepod's visual risk to a visual predator depends morphological features [@aksnes1997]. Notably a copepod's size can increase visual detection. Several studies have documented that copepod size influences DVM magnitude [@hays1994; @aarflot2019]. Presumably, a copepod's transparency will also influence DVM. @hays1994 reported that pigmentation explained variation in DVM frequency. However, few other studies have investigated this at length. One barrier to studying a relationship between copepod morphology and DVM is the difficulty of accurately recording traits.

In-situ imaging tools offer great potential to better describe copepod DVM. By directly observing a copepod, new insights into their behavior and traits can be resolved [@ohman2019b]. For example, @whitmore2021 used an in-situ imaging device to describe a relationship of copepod abundance with a particulate field rather than chlorophyll-a. Such findings are facilitated by the fact imagery data
records an individual\'s exact position. Additionally, a copepod's true appearance can be documented whereas net-collected organisms are often deformed or lacking color. Some studies have noted a copepod DVM with in-situ imagery data [@pan2018; @whitmore2021]. However, direct tests of DVM-related hypotheses with such data have not been conducted.

In this study, we utilized in-situ imaging to evaluate how copepod morphological traits influence patterns. We specifically test the hypotheses that, (H1) size increases visual risk and will increase DVM and (H2) copepod transparency will reduce visual risk and thus reduce DVM. If these morphologically based hypotheses are true, then the larger and darker copepods will have the largest DVM signals.
