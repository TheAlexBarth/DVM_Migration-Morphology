# Abstract

Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic environments. The primary hypothesis explaining DVM is the visual predator evasion hypothesis, which suggests that zooplankton migrate to deeper waters to avoid detection during daylight. However, visual risk also depends on a copepodâ€™s morphology. In this study, we investigate hypotheses related to morphology and DVM: (H1) size increases visual risk and will increase DVM depth and (H2) copepod transparency will reduce visual risk and thus reduce DVM depth. In-situ Copepod images were collected across several cruises in the Sargasso Sea using an Underwater Vision Profiler 5. Copepod morphology was characterized from these images and a dimension reduction approach. The results show a clear relationship in which larger copepods have a larger DVM signal. Darker copepods also have a larger DVM signal, however only amongst the largest group of copepods. This suggests multiple morphological traits influence copepod DVM behavior.
