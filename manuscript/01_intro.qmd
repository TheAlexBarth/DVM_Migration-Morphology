# Introduction

Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a wide spread phenomena with large consequences in ocean ecosystems. DVM is the process of pelagic organisms vertically moving in the water column on a daily basis, often travelling dozens to hundreds of meters [@bianchi2016]. This large-scale event occurs across many taxa, from plankton to fish [@brierley2014]. However, DVM is particularly notable in zooplankton communities, whose migrations contribute substantially to biogeochemical cycles [@steinberg2017; @archibald2019; @siegel2023]. Mesezooplankton communities, largely dominated by copepods [@turner2004], will feed in surface layers of the ocean at night then migrate into deeper waters during daytime. Through this movement, copepods actively transport carbon to depth. Additionally, @kelly2019 described zooplankton DVM to be a major component of mesopelagic food webs. Thus to understand pelagic food webs and nutrient cycles, it is critically important to understand the drivers of DVM.

DVM has long been studied in marine systems [@bandara2021]. Predominantly, zooplankton DVM is the movement from deep waters at daytime to shallower waters at night [@hays2003; @bianchi2016]. However, reverse migration is also well documented [@ohman1990]. There have been several hypotheses as to the proximate and ultimate drivers of DVM.

-   add hypotheses in detail, O2, eat&run/hunger-satiation,

The leading explanation for this pattern is the predator-avoidance hypothesis [@bandara2021]. This hypothesis posits zooplankton evacuate the sunlit surface to evade visual predators then ascend at night to feed. However, the massive migration undertaken by these copepods is energetically expensive [@maas2018; @robison2020]. Therefore, the visual predator evasion hypothesis implies that DVM is a result of visual risk exceeding migration costs.

-   pinti and copepod transition

However, a copepod's visual risk to a visual predator depends on morphological features [@aksnes1997]. Notably a copepod's size can increase visual detection. Several studies have documented that copepod size influences DVM magnitude [@hays1994; @aarflot2019]. Presumably, a copepod's transparency will also influence DVM. @hays1994 reported that pigmentation explained variation in DVM frequency. However, few other studies have investigated this at length. One barrier to studying a relationship between copepod morphology and DVM is the difficulty of accurately recording traits.

Several approaches have been utilized to study DVM. High spatiotemporal resolution of DVM can be achieved through acoustic, and even satellite-based measurements.

However these approaches do not yield information about individuals, much less traits. Net collected specimens can allow for trait-related investigations of copepod DVM patterns [@hays1994; @ohman2016]. Yet traits related to copepod's transparency are not well captured in net-collected specimens who may evacuate gut contents or lose pigmentation following preservation in formalin or ethanol. In-situ imaging tools offer great potential to better describe copepod DVM. By directly observing copepods, new insights into their behavior and traits can be resolved [@ohman2019b]. For example, @whitmore2021 used an in-situ imaging device to describe a relationship between copepod abundance with a particulate field rather than chlorophyll-a. Such findings are facilitated by the fact imagery data records an individual's exact position. Additionally, a copepod's true appearance can be documented whereas net-collected organisms are often physically deformed or lacking color due to decomposition or preservation. Some studies noted a copepod DVM pattern with in-situ imagery data [@pan2018; @whitmore2021]. However, direct tests of DVM-related hypotheses with such data have not been conducted.

In this study, we utilized in-situ imaging to evaluate how copepod morphological traits influence DVM patterns. We specifically test the hypotheses that, (H1) size increases visual risk and will increase DVM magnitude and (H2) copepod transparency will reduce visual risk and thus reduce DVM. If these morphologically based hypotheses are true, then the larger and darker copepods will have the largest DVM signals.
