# Methods

## CTD profiles and UVP imaging of copepods

Data were collected aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer in collaboration with the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) [@steinberg2001]. In-situ images of plankton were acquired using an Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) [@picheral2010]. The original sampling methodology and instrument specification followed details described in @barth2022. The UVP was attached to the CTD rosette and deployed regularly on cruises to the Sargasso Sea from June 2019 - December 2021. Typical monthly cruises included \~13 profiles with average descents to 1200m (Supplemental Figure 1). In this study, we investigated general trends in DVM by pooling together casts across multiple cruises. This approach is necessitated by the small sampling volume of the UVP and low abundance of plankton which requires aggregation of data to resolve trends [@barth2022]. While there was some variation between cruises (Supplemental Figure 2), this oligotrophic system is relatively consistent across seasons. Additionally, every cruise had an approximately equal number of day and night casts. Profiles were assigned to be day or night based on locally calculated nautical dawn and nautical dusk times using the R package `suncalc 0.5.1`.

The UVP records images of large particles (\>600$\mu$m ESD). However, living particles are not reliably identifiable below 0.9 mm [@barth2022]. All recorded images were processed using Zooprocess [@gorsky2010], which provides several metrics related to size, grey value, and shape complexity. These features were then used to automatically sort images using Ecotaxa [@picheral]. All images were manually verified by the same trained taxonomist. In total, 294,913 images were recorded. Of these, 85.2% were images of debris or artefacts. The smallest identified copepod was 0.940mm ESD and the largest was 5.904mm ESD. Across all casts, copepods were the most common organism, composing 58.7% of all identified, living particles. In total, there were 4151 individual copepods images.

## Morphological Grouping

Zooprocess measures and collects several morphologically relevant parameters. To create relevant groups of copepods, a dimension reduction approach was used. Similar methods have been successfully utilized to provide novel insights to marine snow [@trudnowska2021], copepod dynamics in the Arctic [@vilgrain2021], and temporal trends in phytoplankton communities [@sonnet2022]. First, 18 morphologically relevant parameters were selected to be included in a principal Components Analysis (PCA), following [@vilgrain2021]. Parameters can be described as relating to size (e.g. major axis, feret diameter, ESD), grey intensity (e.g. mean grey value at 625nm wavelength light), shape (e.g. elongation, symmetry), and shape complexity (e.g. fractal dimension). The PCA was weighted by the volume sampled in a 1-m depth bin for each observation. This approach provides a correction for the UVP's variable descent speed which can cause duplicate imaging of individuals. While this phenomena has a minor impact on overall results [@barth2022], we used the weighted approach to assure that no individual features were overrepresented. All morphological descriptors were scaled and centered prior to inclusion in the analysis. The model was constructed using the R package `FactoMineR 2.7`. principal components were deemed to be significant if their eigenvalues were greater than 1. This approach yielded 4 PCs which described 87.3% of the total variation in morphological parameters, with 34.5% and 26.5% in the first two components respectively. This four principal component space provides a "morphospace" to characterize copepods.

To address our morphology-DVM hypotheses, we constructed discrete morphological groups based on the first two principal components. Groups along each of the principal components were defined as low (below 25th percentile), mid (25th-75th percentile) and high (greater than 75th percentile). To address the size-dependent hypothesis (H1), groups were assigned as low, mid, or high along PC1. Then to assess if color/transparency was a secondary factor (H2), within each PC1 group, PC2 groups were constructed as low, mid, or high. In total, this created 9 groups (e.g. Low PC1-Low PC2, Low P1-mid PC2, etc).

## Copepod vertical structure & DVM

### Vertical distribution of copepods

Copepods in this system are well documented to undergo DVM [@steinberg2000; @schnetzer2002; @maas2018]. However, there have not been direct measurements of DVM with in-situ imaging data. First, to assess which portion of the water column copepods were utilizing for DVM, we visualized the average vertical structure. The concentrations of each morphological group (based on PC1 and PC2) were calculated in 20m depth bins for each UVP profile. These binned-profiles were then averaged together based on time of day.

### Weighted mean depth variability

Weighted mean depth (WMD) is a common metric to describe vertical structure and DVM in zooplankton [@ohman2002; @ohman2016; @aarflot2019]. However, with in-situ imagery, this approach presents a few challenges. WMD cannot be calculated individually for each profile then averaged because each profile had a different descent depth. Additionally, the small and uneven sampling volume of the UVP can make single casts too variable to reliably resolve abundance. Yet, understanding variation around the WMD is necessary to compare DVM strength across groups. Here, we introduce a depth-bin constrained bootstrap approach to define WMD with a 95% confidence interval. To do this, the concentration of each group, was calculated in 20m depth bins for each profile. Then all profiles from the same time of day were 'pooled'. This provides a distribution of concentrations in each depth-bin. Traditional bootstrapping randomly samples, with replacement, all observations. With vertically structured data however, full random sampling would bias estimates towards the surface. To avoid this, samples were "bin-constrained" such that for each iteration, a random observation was sampled within each depth bin, then replaced for the next iteration. A maximum depth was set to 600m based on observations of vertical profiles which indicated this to be the maximum point of day/night differences. This approach effectively created a random profile by resampling a concentration, $conc^*$, from each depth bin, $d$. This profile then was used to calculate a bootstrapped weighted mean depth, $WMD^*$. This was done for each morphological group $g$, at each time of day $t$.

$$WMD^*_{g,t} = \sum_{i}^{N = 60}{\frac{d_i(conc^*_{i,g,t})}{\sum_i^{N = 60}{conc^*_{i,g,t}}}}$$

The distribution of $WMD^*_{g,t}$ then was used to calculate a bootstrapped mean and 95% confidence interval. The 95% CIs could be compared between times of day and morphological groups to assess the strength of DVM. Using PC1 to assess size, the WMD was compared between the three PC1-groups by percentile level. Then to assess the effect of transparency the WMD was compared between PC2-groups within each PC1-grouping. A larger signal of DVM would be evident by a clearly deeper (non-overlapping 95% CI) daytime WMD.
